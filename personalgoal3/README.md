# Personal Learning Goal 3 – Statistical analysis

## Background
My third learning goal is to become better at analysing data by applyign more statistical methods. Currently often when I analyse results I put the results into easily made bar graphs or pie charts. By the end of the course, I want to be able to use more advanced statistical approaches to analyse our projects data results. As this might also becomes useful later for my thesis. To demonsstrate this I will practice analysing the datasets used in the group project and apply more advanced statistical methods when creating graphs. My progress will be measured by the quality and clarity of the graphs in the final project and feedback from my group members and the teacher on whether the graphs effectively support our analysis.

## Methodology and Data Source
### Methodology
- Calculated basis statistics such as mean, median, count, min, max, and standard deviation.
- Create histogram for each country
- Created boxplot and violin plots to show distribution of sentiment. 
- Created a temporal plot to show average sentiment over the last two weeks for top five countries
- I computed correlation between sentiment and different weather variables such as cloud cover, precipitation, average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimim temperature. 
- I computed coeficient of determination (R2) between sentiment and different weather variables such as cloud cover, precipitation, average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimim temperature.
- I created a temporal graph to show sentiment, rainfall, and temperature for a chosen country, for the last two weeks.

### Packages that I used
- Geopandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Folium
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Math

## Results
During the presentations I reflected a bit and I aslo asked around if the visuals were clear. For example I asked Jelle about our visuals.
