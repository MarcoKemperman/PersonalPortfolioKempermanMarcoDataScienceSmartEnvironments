# Personal Learning Goal 3 – Statistical analysis

## Background
My third learning goal is to become better at analysing data by applyign more statistical methods. Currently often when I analyse results I put the results into easily made bar graphs or pie charts. By the end of the course, I want to be able to use more advanced statistical approaches to analyse our projects data results. As this might also becomes useful later for my thesis. To demonsstrate this I will practice analysing the datasets used in the group project and apply more advanced statistical methods when creating graphs. My progress will be measured by the quality and clarity of the graphs in the final project and feedback from my group members and the teacher on whether the graphs effectively support our analysis.
