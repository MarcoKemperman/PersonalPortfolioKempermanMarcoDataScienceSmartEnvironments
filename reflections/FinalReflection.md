Reflection on Group Work and Contribution

If I am being honest, the group work did not go as well as I had hoped. During the first week, Simen was still stuck in Norway due to snow issues at Schiphol. As a result, we mainly had to work with three people, and most of the collaboration was online. Because of this, communication did not go very smoothly. It was difficult to see what everyone was working on. Despite this, I tried to keep the group updated on my progress. For example, I already got some code working to retrieve Bluesky posts. At the end of the first week, Tom and I gave the presentation together.

In the second week, I continued working on the code, and Simen was now present and able to help me. Meanwhile, Jingxi and Tom worked on the ethics posters. During this week, I started to become more dissatisfied with the group collaboration. Already in the first week, I felt that I had put in the most work, but I accepted this because it was an unusual week with working from home. However, in the second week, I hoped that we would work more together at the university. Unfortunately, this was not really the case. On Tuesday afternoon, for example, I was the only one working at university. On several other days, I also stayed later than the rest of the group. Additionally, on Friday, I created the PowerPoint for the presentation and presented again, this time together with Simen.

At this point, I should have communicated my dissatisfaction to the group, but I did not. This was a mistake on my part. I should have told them that I was not satisfied with the collaboration and that I would have preferred everyone to be more present at the university.

During weeks 2 and 3, Tom was often not at university and preferred to work from home due to the travel distance. I understand that driving every day can be difficult, and I accepted that he worked from home. However, I noticed that he did not seem to put as much time into the project. He did contribute to the posters and possibly some other tasks, but this likely did not take a large amount of time. He mentioned that I could text him if I wanted him to do something, but I did not do this. This is partly my mistake. I am not a natural leader, and I found it difficult to tell people what to do or to assign tasks.

Jingxi was more often at university and worked well when I gave her specific tasks. However, when I did not assign tasks, she did not do that much, and I think she found it difficult to know what to work on. This is also partly my responsibility. I should have checked more often whether she knew what to do and asked what she would like to work on. In the last week, I gave her a task to work on the StoryMaps, and she did this well. This showed me that if I had given her more tasks earlier, she probably would have contributed more.

Simen worked well with me on the code during weeks 2 and 3. However, on some afternoons he went home earlier or was not present. In the last week, he was sick one day, but he only informed me at the end of the day instead of in the morning, even after I had asked if he would be there. Because of this, I had to take over the task of combining the weather data with the sentiment data. Overall, I think Simen contributed well in the last two weeks and coded together with me, but I still spent significantly more time on the project.

As a result of me doing a large part of the work, I noticed that during all three presentations I had to answer most of the questions. While I was capable of doing this, I did not really like it, as it made it seem like I was the only one who fully understood the project. I also created the PowerPoint for the final presentation. When Tom wanted to help with it, I noticed that it was difficult for him to contribute because he was no longer fully aware of what the project was doing. For example, he still thought we were getting location data from the bio, while we had already switched to using location from the posts.

Again, this could partly be my fault for not communicating these changes clearly enough. However, I also expected a more proactive attitude from some of my group members, such as asking what I was working on or what still needed to be done. I do not enjoy being the leader of the group, but if I end up in that role, I expect people to take initiative and actively ask how they can contribute.

I am aware that many of these issues are also partly my responsibility. I do not want to say that my group members did nothing. Everyone contributed something and delivered parts of the project. However, the majority of the work for this group project was done by me. All of the visualisations, graphs, and maps were coded by me (together with AI). I understand that not everyone is comfortable with coding, and I do not expect everyone to code. However, I did hope for more collaboration and a more proactive attitude from the team.

Because I spent so much time on the group project, I now still have to create my entire personal portfolio in the fourth and final week, while I saw that others had already started working on theirs in week 3. I did not have time to do this earlier, as I was focused on completing our group project.

I am not writing this to blame others, but to give context. I would like this to be taken into consideration when grading both the group project and my personal portfolio, as I believe I have put in significantly more time and effort than others. At first, I did not mind, as I learned many new and interesting things related to coding, APIs, and natural language processing. However, in the last week, this situation became more frustrating for me.

To conclude, as this is a reflection, I could have done better in communicating my frustrations. In future group projects, I should divide tasks better so that the division is more equal. In addition, I should point out my personal preference of working on campus and I should point out if someone does not work that much for the group, even though I am a conflict avoidant person. 

### Reflection on what went well and not so well. 

`Proficient data science skills are applied to meet ALL their learning goals. - demonstratable range of skills with novel skills to meet learning goals`

`Data quality is evaluated using a range of appropriate techniques -Understanding of its limitations are sufficiently acknowledged and steps taken are clear and retraceable.`

`Examples of societal implications are clearly reflected on and the examples given are sufficient with references -societal implications are novel and stimulate innovation`

`BCC examples (x2) provided with a reflection and connection between own learning path and clear delineation of BCC (Identification/coordination/refl
ection/transformation) is identified -reference provided and motivation to continue developing BCC competence is stated.`
