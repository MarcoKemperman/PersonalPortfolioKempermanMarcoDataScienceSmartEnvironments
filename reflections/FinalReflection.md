# Final reflection 
### Reflection on learning goals:

### Reflection on Data quality and methods: 

### Reflection on societal implications of our project, and potenial use of application. 

### Reflection on Boundary Crossing Competences

### Reflection on group
If I am being honest, the group work did not go that well as I hoped. The first week, Simen was still stuck in Norway, due to the snow issues at Schiphol. So in the first week, we mainly had to work with the three of us. Due to the first week mainly being online, the communication did not go that well. It is difficult to see what everyone is doing. But still, I tried to update the others on what I was doing. For example, I already got some code working to retrieve bluesky posts. At the end of the week on Friday we had presentation where I was one of the presentors together with Tom. 

The second week, I worked more on the code, and Simen was now also there to help me with it. Furthermore, Jingxi and Tom, worked on the ethics posters. This week, I started to be a bit more unsatisfied with my group. First of all, I noticed that I put the most work in the project. Already, in the first week, I put the most work in the project, but I accepted it, because it was a strange week with the working from home. But in the second week, I hoped that we would work more as a group at University. This was unfortunate not the case, as on Tuesday afternoon, I was the only one working at university. Moreover, some of the other afternoons, I also worked until a later hour than the rest of the group. Moreover, on friday, I made the powerpoint for the presentation. And I did the presentation again, this time together with Simen. 

At this point, I should have pointed out my dissatisfaction to the group, however, I did not do  this, which is a mistake on my part. I should have told them that I was unsatisfied with our group collaboration, and that I would have liked everyone to be at university. 

Most of the days in week 2 and 3, Tom was also not at University. He prefered working from home as he had to drive to university. Something that I have to do myself too. I understand that driving every day for him, it can be difficult, and I accepted him to work from home. However, I noticed that he did not put that much work into the project at home. Of course, he made some of the posters, and might have worked on some other stuff, but all of this probably took not that much time. He did tell, that I could text him if I wanted him to do something, but I have not done this in the three weeks. Maybe this is a mistake at my part, but personally I am not really a great leader, and I found it difficult to command people to do something. 

Jingxi was more often at university, and she worked well on tasks if I gave tasks to her, but when I did not gave tasks she did not do that much, and I think she found it difficult to know where to work on. This is partly my mistake, I should have asked her more often I she knows what to do, and I should have asked more on what she would like to work on. In the last week, I gave her a task to do, working on the StoryMaps, and I found out that she worked well on this. So probably if I gave more tasks to her she would have done more for the project. 

For Simen I think he did work well on the code with me in week 2 and 3. However, in some of the afternoons he went home earlier, or was not there. Also in the last week, he was sick one day, which he texted at the end of the day. Instead of in the morning, when I texted him if he would be there this day.  

### Reflection on what went well and not so well. 

`Proficient data science skills are applied to meet ALL their learning goals. - demonstratable range of skills with novel skills to meet learning goals`

`Data quality is evaluated using a range of appropriate techniques -Understanding of its limitations are sufficiently acknowledged and steps taken are clear and retraceable.`

`Examples of societal implications are clearly reflected on and the examples given are sufficient with references -societal implications are novel and stimulate innovation`

`BCC examples (x2) provided with a reflection and connection between own learning path and clear delineation of BCC (Identification/coordination/refl
ection/transformation) is identified -reference provided and motivation to continue developing BCC competence is stated.`
