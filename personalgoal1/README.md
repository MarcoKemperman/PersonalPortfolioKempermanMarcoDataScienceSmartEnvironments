# Personal Learning Goal 1 – Storing Data 

## Background
Become better at storing data in a clear, organized way, especially in a team setting where more than one person has to know where things are and where things can be found. Currently, I often store data wherever. I store my documents in downloads, or I throw everything into one map. This becomes a problem when I want to retrieve the documents again. So at the end of the course, I want our group project to be organised well. To become better in this, I will support our group in doing the data storage and making an easily overviewed folder structure. To measure my progress, I will ask my group members to get their sentiment on the folder structure.
