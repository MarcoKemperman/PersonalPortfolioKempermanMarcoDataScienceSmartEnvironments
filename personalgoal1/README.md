# Personal Learning Goal 1 – Storing Data 

## Background
Become better at storing data in a clear, organized way, especially in a team setting where more than one person has to know where things are and where things can be found. Currently, I often store data wherever. I store my documents in downloads, or I throw everything into one map. This becomes a problem when I want to retrieve the documents again. So at the end of the course, I want our group project to be organised well. To become better in this, I will support our group in doing the data storage and making an easily overviewed folder structure. To measure my progress, I will ask my group members to get their sentiment on the folder structure.

## Methodology and Data Source
### Methodology
- Creating clear Teams Folders
- Working together online in Google Colab
- Creating a GitHub repository to store data for StoryMaps and to create Personal Porftolio repository
- Used StoryMaps to visualise our research
- Used Canva to work on posters

### Programs used
- Microsoft Teams
- Google Colab
- GitHub repository
- StoryMaps
- Canva

## Results
The last three weeks I used different programs to store data in an organized way for our project. First of all, we created a Teams channel, in where I created multiple folders. Each folder had its own purpose. For example, in week 1, I created the folders Personal Plan, Project Plan, Code, and Presentations. The personal plan folders was created so that we could see from each other about what our goals were. 

Furthermore, in the second week we started to work with Google Colab. In week 1 I created already some code on my own laptop. But as everyone should be able to help and support the coding, Simen and I, decided to make a Google Colab. This was the first time for me working in Google Colab, and I think it went pretty well. We sended the access link of the Google Colab in our WhatsApp group. 

In the third week, I expanded our Teams channel with more folders to structure the data more organized. I created the folders Data, Final Reports, Social and Ethical, and Visualisations. Additonally, I created the StoryMaps this week. Jingxi and I found out that we could unfortunately not work on the StoryMap together at the same time. So after I created the StoryMaps a bit with some text and visualisations, I handed the task over to her. Also we worked in Canva this week, as we had to hand in the posters. I did not work that much on the posters, but I did change some text and visualisation in poster 1 and 3. 

At last, in the third week, I also started to learn how to use GitHub. I had to use GitHub because otherwise I could not upload the interactive map into the StoryMaps. Because embedding only works for online html files and not local ones. Also to make this personal portfolio I also used GitHub, as I thought it would be good for my learning goal to explore more on how GitHub works. 

## Conclusions
### Conclusions on Results
Overall, I am quite satisfied how I organized our group files. I think it was pretty clear where everything could be found. I also learned new programs such as GitHub and Google Colab. Both programs that I did not work in before. Unfortunately, there are always some thing that I am not quite that satisfied about. For example, I think the Google Colab was not that clear for everyone in the group. I found out in the last week, that Jingxi did not know that the Google Colab access link was sent into our WhatsApp group chat. As the WhatApp group chat is not a great place to store these links or files, I think it would have been better if we would have been able to access the Google Colab environment from Teams. Moreover, I also still think I downloaded too many files into my downloads folder. Most of these files I uploaded immediately to our Teams folder, but still some of these files I uploaded a bit later. 

### Conclusions on Accomplishment of the Goal
So to conclude I think I partially achieved my personal goal. I did became better in storing data, but still some issues were there such as the Google Colab link and some of the files uploaded a bit later. Personally, I think the most important bit about what I learned is that I now always think about the storing of the data. I might not have done it perfectly every time for this project. But at least, every time I downloaded something I thought about my personal goal, and where to store the data. Therefore, I think this personal goal has been valuable for me, as it makes me think critically about my data organisation.
