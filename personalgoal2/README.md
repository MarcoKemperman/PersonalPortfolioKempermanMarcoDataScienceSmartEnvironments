# Personal Learning Goal 2 – API and Natural Language Processing models

## Background
My second learning goal is that I would like to learn more about API and natural language process (NLP) models, and how I can use them to answer research questions. I would like to learn this as I would like to use NLP models for my own master thesis. Currently, I have limited knowledge on API and NLP models. I have never used a NLP model before so I would like to use one of these models in this course. Furthermore, only once I used an API to access Google Earth Engine on python, but I did not really understood that well how it worked. So at the end of the course, I can use API and I have learned to use NLP models. I will demonstrate this by providing code of the API connection and by creating a Jupyter notebook on how I used a NLP model.

## Methodology and Data Source
### Methodology
- Work with BlueSky API to retrieve posts about weather sentiment
- Work with Meteostat API and retrieve daily weather data
- Connecting a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model from Hugging Face with our code. 
- Studied the aspects of the NLP

### Programs used
- BlueSky
- MeteoStat
- OpenWeatherMap
- Hugging Face

## Results
The results are shown in the included Jupyter Notebook that has been stored within this folder.
