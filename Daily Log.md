# Daily Log

#### **Monday 5th January:**
On the first day we made groups and we started to think about some possible topics. We came to the conclusion that the social media one interested us the most. I also wanted to do that one as it could involve natural language processing which I may use in my Master thesis. The topic we decided on was the sentiment of people towards the weather in Europe. 
Furthermore, on the first day I started to write my first two personal learning goals. The first one about data storing and organisation. In where I really want to become better in. And the second one about trying to understand and figuring out how to use API and natural language processing models for the purpose of answering questions. This is also important later for my master thesis.

On the second day I started to think about the third personal learning goal. I came to the conclusion that I also want to learn more about data analysation. As usually I analyse data just with bar charts or pie charts which is pretty easy. This time I would like to use more statistics or more advanced data analysation processes, as they might also become useful later for my thesis. 
Furthermore I started to code this day. I was worried about if our project was feasible so I started to work on it a little bit already. Together with the teacher we found out that location data could not be retrieved from Bluesky with the API. But something to work around it could be to use locations that people have in their bio. Together with AI (ChatGPT 5o) I started to code and got some code working to retrieve information from Bluesky and together with a Natural language processing model I also could retrieve if something was positively sentiment or negatively sentiment. Furthermore AI was used to debug the code in case there were errors.

#### **Wednesday 7th January**
On the third day we had a lecture about anaconda, jupyterbook and Geoda. Because yesterday the processing of the data took long I started to figure out how I could change my processing power from CPU to GPU, for faster processing. Furthermore I started to write some jupytherbook to figure the program out and to make sure I could use it later for my individual portfolio. 
I also updated my daily log and I finished my third learning goal. 
In the afternoon we had a pandas lecture. Worked on the pandas modules. 

#### **Thursday 8th January**
On the fourth day of the week we started with a short intro lecture. After that I made a start on the folder structure of our group. After that I called Arend about our progress and about some questions that I had about personal plan. After that I worked on the project plan and finished the text. In the afternoon I worked on the presentation that Tom has started on. Furthermore I worked on the ethical assignment.  

#### **Friday 9th January**
Today we had presentation. I presented our presentation and answered the questions. Moreover I listened to other presentations. In the afternoon I handed in the personal plan. And another groupmate handed in our project plan

#### **Monday 12th January**
In the morning we first had a lesson about databases and sql. After that we divided the tasks. Two of us worked on ethics while me and Simen worked on the code. We started to work in google colab so that it is easier for us to work together. We got our code working again, and started to add stuff to the code. For example, we added key words, we added api authentication with account so that we can use more key words, we added countries, and we changed sentiment from -1, 0, and 1, to decimal numbers. We averaged the sentiment of every country to make a interactive map in where you can see the number of posts of each country and the average weather sentiment.
