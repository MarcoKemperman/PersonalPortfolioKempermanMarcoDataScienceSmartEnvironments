# Daily Log

#### **Monday 5th January:**
On the first day we made groups and we started to think about some possible topics. We came to the conclusion that the social media one interested us the most. I also wanted to do that one as it could involve natural language processing which I may use in my Master thesis. The topic we decided on was the sentiment of people towards the weather in Europe. 
Furthermore, on the first day I started to write my first two personal learning goals. The first one about data storing and organisation. In where I really want to become better in. And the second one about trying to understand and figuring out how to use API and natural language processing models for the purpose of answering questions. This is also important later for my master thesis.

On the second day I started to think about the third personal learning goal. I came to the conclusion that I also want to learn more about data analysation. As usually I analyse data just with bar charts or pie charts which is pretty easy. This time I would like to use more statistics or more advanced data analysation processes, as they might also become useful later for my thesis. 
Furthermore I started to code this day. I was worried about if our project was feasible so I started to work on it a little bit already. Together with the teacher we found out that location data could not be retrieved from Bluesky with the API. But something to work around it could be to use locations that people have in their bio. Together with AI (ChatGPT 5o) I started to code and got some code working to retrieve information from Bluesky and together with a Natural language processing model I also could retrieve if something was positively sentiment or negatively sentiment. Furthermore AI was used to debug the code in case there were errors.

#### **Wednesday 7th January**
On the third day we had a lecture about anaconda, jupyterbook and Geoda. Because yesterday the processing of the data took long I started to figure out how I could change my processing power from CPU to GPU, for faster processing. Furthermore I started to write some jupytherbook to figure the program out and to make sure I could use it later for my individual portfolio. 
I also updated my daily log and I finished my third learning goal. 
In the afternoon we had a pandas lecture. Worked on the pandas modules. 

#### **Thursday 8th January**
On the fourth day of the week we started with a short intro lecture. After that I made a start on the folder structure of our group. After that I called Arend about our progress and about some questions that I had about personal plan. After that I worked on the project plan and finished the text. In the afternoon I worked on the presentation that Tom has started on. Furthermore I worked on the ethical assignment.  

#### **Friday 9th January**
Today we had presentation. I presented our presentation and answered the questions. Moreover I listened to other presentations. In the afternoon I handed in the personal plan. And another groupmate handed in our project plan

#### **Monday 12th January**
In the morning we first had a lesson about databases and sql. After that we divided the tasks. Two of us worked on ethics while me and Simen worked on the code. We started to work in google colab so that it is easier for us to work together. We got our code working again, and started to add stuff to the code. For example, we added key words, we added api authentication with account so that we can use more key words, we added countries, and we changed sentiment from -1, 0, and 1, to decimal numbers. We averaged the sentiment of every country to make a interactive map in where you can see the number of posts of each country and the average weather sentiment.

#### **Tuesday 13th January**
worked on code, learned about machine learning. Got our code more efficient. We got it to a level of 1700 rows per 38 minutes. Added API connections to weather programs, also learned more about the connection with the natural language processing model. 

#### **Wednesday 14th January** 
worked on code too. Got a lot of statistics working. Such as the histograms, the boxplots and violionplots, and the weather sentiment trend per country for the last 7 days. So today was a good day for my data analysis and statistics personal goal.

#### **Thursday 15th January**
we first had a lecture on ethics and privacy. We devided the work in the group so that we could work further on code and the others could work on the posters. Most importantly for today we made sure to clean the code. So that it is more efficient and understandable. As we created a lot of new code the last days and it became a bit of a mess. I also worked again on this personal reflection. And I started to work on the presentation for tomorrow. 

#### **Friday 16th January** 
we had presentations and we also worked on our code. We got a date filter working but it was very slow. I also started to work on the Stormyap that day, we find out that we can not work together in the same storymap so only one could work in it. 

#### **Monday 17th January** 
we had a difficult day. The code from last friday was not working anymore. So we had to change it too a previous version and work from there again. We had a lot of difficulties and decided to get rid of the date filtering, as it was maybe breaking our code. We got a lot of 429 time out errors and 500 time out errors. Together with Jelle we tried to solve it but it didn't really work. In the end, we also decided to make a new bluesky account with a new API key, and together with some time.sleep functions we got our code working again. At the end of the day at home, I was planning to run the new code overnight. I started to run the code at 0;00. And because I was afraid that the code would crash during the night I stayed up until it was done. Around 2:15 the code was finished running and we got a CSV file with around 9250 posts about weather in 20 capitals of Europe. 

#### **Tuesday 18th January** 
I worked on the methods and limitations of our project. I wrote all of the limitations and I also worked further on our storymap. I also created the workflow diagram using draw.io. Furthermore I updated a bit of my daily log. Just before the afternoon lesson, I also reviewed the posters that my groupmembers made, and I changed and added some stuff. In the afternoon we had a interesting lecture about Ethics and AI. 

#### **Wednesday 19th January**
I worked on the data again. I runned the code two more times. It did not change even though I added some more filter words to be forbidden to leave out the noise by bots. Therefore, the filtering out was dan after the CSV file was retrieved. Furthermore, this day I worked on the statistics again. I find how to do the correlation between weather and sentiment. Therefore, I worked on the R2 and I worked on the correlation between weather data and sentiment data about the weather. Furthermore I changed all the graphs and maps so that it looked better. Furthermore I made a GitHub repository to add the HTML map there so that it could be embedded within Storymaps. At last I started working on the presentation and I filled in my daily log.

#### **Thursday 20th January** 
Today I worked partly on the code but mainly on the presentation of tomorrow. I also changed some text for the Storymaps, and I made the dynamic temporal map for Europe. I edited the code to have better hearders and a better overall structure. In the afternoon, we also had a ethics sessions.

###  **Friday 21th January** 
Today I worked on the presentation in the morning, and I presented in the afternoon, after the presentations I also worked on reflection week 3 and I handed it in.
